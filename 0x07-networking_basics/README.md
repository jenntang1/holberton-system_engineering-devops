# Overview #
The program codes contained in this directory is to help with learning and understanding computer networks.  

## General ##
0. OSI Model  
a. What it is?  OSI Model is how applications communicate over a network.  
b. How many layers it has?  In total, there are seven layers that are organzied from lowest to highest.  
c. How it is organized?  The lowest level aka layer 1 is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal.  Layer 2 is for handling data moving in and out of a physical link in a network and handles problems that occurred as as a result of bit transmission errors.  Layer 3 is for handling data moving in and out of other networks through packaging data with correct network addresses, selecting the correct network routs and forwarding the data.  Layer 4 is for handling data moving across a network.  Layer 5 is for coordination and termination of conversations between applications.  Layer 6 is for translating data for the applicationn and it handles encrytion and decryption for the application.  Layer 7 is for interaction between the application and the user.
